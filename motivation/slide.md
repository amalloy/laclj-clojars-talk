# Paul Graham loves utilities

In Lisp, you don’t just write your program down toward the language, you also
build the language up toward your program. As you’re writing a program you may
think “I wish Lisp had suchand-such an operator.” So you go and write
it. Afterward you realize that using the new operator would simplify the design
of another part of the program, and so on. Language and program evolve
together. Like the border between two warring states, the boundary between
language and program is drawn and redrawn, until eventually it comes to rest
along the mountains and rivers, the natural frontiers of your problem. In the
end your program will look as if the language had been designed for it.

# It's not that hard

* "Library" is just a blob of useful code
* Clojure is perfect for this
  * JVM has great distrubution tools
  * Lisp has great abstraction tools
* Never copy-paste functions!
